# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a flexible and extensible implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring support for 2 to 4 players and customizable board sizes up to 7x7. 

**Features:**

- **Resizable Window:** The game window can be resized to any desired dimensions, with the game board and other elements scaling dynamically to fit the window size.

- **Scalable Player Support:** The game supports 2 to 4 players, which can be adjusted within the graphical user interface.

- **Scalable Board Sizes:** With support for board sizes ranging from 3x3 to 7x7, which can also be configured within the graphical user interface.

- **Efficient Bot Implementation:** The project includes bot support, featuring a minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection. Before each game, each player can be configured to be played by the bot using the user interface. The bot's decision-making process is designed to be both intelligent and computationally efficient, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience. The bot is designed to never be defeated in a 3x3 game, and it provides an incredibly challenging opponent in larger board sizes as well.

The project is implemented in Python, utilizing the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. The game's core logic is implemented in a modular and extensible manner, allowing for easy customization and extension of the game's features.
